    <p>'Https' is the protocol for the url. 'https' is a protocol for transmitting HTML between web browsers and web servers. This is the core protocol that governs transmission of data on the internet. It is an access protocol. The client computer requests through HTTP that the website be available. The web server responds via HTTP and shares the website data</p>

    <p>Next is the colon and double slash. The colon simply separates the protocol and domain/subdomain. The double slash was a mistake which occurred when the web was first created. It has no real purpose. </p>

    <p>'www' is an acronym for 'World Wide Web'. </p>
