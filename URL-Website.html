    <h1><center><u>Uniform Resource Locator</u></center></h1>
    <h3><center>A Uniform Resource Locator, more commonly known by the the acronym 'URL', is the adress of a resource on the web.</center></h3>
    <center><img src="https://www.lucamussari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/parts-of-a-url-luca-mussari-com.png" alt="Example URL" width='950'></center>
    
    <center><ul style="border-style: solid; border-color: orangered; padding: 2em;">'Https' is the protocol for the url. 'https' is a protocol for transmitting HTML between web browsers and web servers. This is the core protocol that governs transmission of data on the internet. It is an access protocol. The client computer requests through HTTP that the website be available. The web server responds via HTTP and shares the website data.
    <br><br>
    Next is the colon and double slash. The colon simply separates the protocol and domain/subdomain. The double slash was a mistake which occurred when the web was first created. It has no real purpose.
    <br><br>
    A subdomain is a way to organise a website, it is an additional part of a domain and is used to navigate subsections of a website. For example, <a href="https://louisthechild.com/">louisthechild.com</a> has a merch shop, acessed by adding the subdomain "store" (<a href="https://store.louisthechild.com/">store.louisthechild.com</a>)
    <br><br>
    'www' is an acronym for 'World Wide Web'.
    <br><br>
    The domain is the name of the website.
    <br><br>
    The root domain is the structure of the URL. Examples of a root domain are:
    
        <ul>
            <li>.com</li>
            <li>.net</li>
            <li>.gov</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    The path to the file comes after the root domain. It navigates you to the exact location of the webpage.
    <br><br>
    The anchor is the page number or another piece of clickable text on a website.
    <br><br>
    Finally, the URL query parameters are pieces of information about the person on the website. The parameter comes after a question mark. The parameter is in the form "Variable" = "Value".
    </ul>
